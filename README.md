# Project Name: Child Health and Vaccination Analysis in Kenya

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to child health and vaccination in Kenya from the years 2021 to May 2023. The dataset contains valuable insights into the vaccination rates, prevalence of stunted growth, underweight children, and the incidence of health conditions like diarrhea in various counties across Kenya.

The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and progress in child healthcare within the country. It explores the correlation between underweight children and diarrhea, identifies counties with the highest and lowest vaccination rates, and highlights the prevalence of stunted growth among different age groups.

## Data Cleaning

Before performing the analysis, the dataset underwent data cleaning procedures. Missing values in each column were replaced with the mean value for the respective county. This ensured the data was more accurate and provided a comprehensive representation of each region's child health indicators.

## Key Findings

1. **Vaccination Trends:** The number of children being vaccinated has shown a steady increase from 2021 to May 2023. However, there are notable fluctuations in vaccination rates across months. The months of January, April, and August have the least number of children vaccinated, while May, June, and November have the highest numbers.

2. **Stunted Growth:** Children between the ages of 6 and 23 months are the most affected by stunted growth in Kenya, with approximately 400,000 cases. This is followed by children below 6 months with around 200,000 cases and those between 24 and 59 months with about 16,000 cases.

3. **Underweight Children:** Similarly, children between 6 and 23 months are the most affected by underweight, with around 920,000 cases, followed by those between 24 and 59 months with approximately 431,000 cases. Children below 6 months have the lowest number of underweight cases at about 32,000.

4. **Health Conditions Across Counties:** Nairobi county has the highest number of children dewormed, possibly due to its larger population and better healthcare facilities. Conversely, Wajir county has a higher prevalence of acute malnutrition, which could be attributed to drought, famine, and insecurity affecting the region.

5. **Diarrhea Cases:** Nairobi leads in the prevalence of diarrhea cases, followed by Kilifi and Turkana counties. Factors such as sanitation, access to clean water, and overall health infrastructure may contribute to the variations in diarrhea cases among counties.

6. **Underweight Children by County:** Turkan has the highest number of underweight children between 24 and 59 months, followed by Marsabit county.

## Conclusion

The analysis provided valuable insights into child health and vaccination trends in Kenya. It sheds light on the challenges faced in ensuring children receive proper healthcare and vaccinations across different regions. By understanding these patterns, policymakers, healthcare professionals, and NGOs can develop targeted interventions to improve child health outcomes in Kenya.

The visualizations and findings presented in this project can serve as a foundation for further research and decision-making processes aimed at enhancing the well-being of children and achieving better overall healthcare outcomes in the country.
